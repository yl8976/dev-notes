# Developer Notes

These are notes to remind myself on my workflow all in one place.

## Terminal/iTerm

- Shortcuts are stored in the `~/.bash_profile` text file
- `lazygit` takes 1 argument (the commit description), and pushes it automatically to the `master` branch
- If you ever add new functions, refresh it by running `source ~/.bash_profile`
- `ctrl-U` clears the current line
- `cmd-K` clears the window
- `cmd-shift-K` clears the window **and** history above it
